# ImageColourReplicator & CalcAPixel
A fun little experiment. The idea was - provide an image and try to replicate a second image, using only the colours of the first one. Feel free to experiment. I'm still trying to get it to accept urls, instead of using local images. 
For *insert reason here* test.py is the actual working file 

Results vary (obviously), but results can be like: 
# Original

# Replicated

# CalcAPixel
A script that extracts all unique colour values from an image and presents them in an *interesting* way

A massive thank you to the developers of PIL (pillow) for python
